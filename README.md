# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Attempting to inject a database query at the end of the URL of a salesperon page with ```'OR 1'--``` causes the database query to fail. This error shows the endless possibilites of potential SQLi. Red and Green properly reroute you when attempting this there.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Log into your account and add ```/hacktools/change_session_id.php``` to the end of the url. You are able to copy your current session id. On a different browser or private/incognito varient of your current browser, access ```https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/hacktools/change_session_id.php``` and paste the session id obtained from the logged in user and click "Change." Now when you access ```https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/``` you are logged in without ever logging in!
